#### Why Does This Matter?

As quantum computing evolves, it threatens to undermine the very foundation of digital security. Post-quantum strategies are critical to future-proofing our systems, protecting everything from online banking to healthcare data and national security secrets. Classical security remains essential today, but organizations must begin preparing for a post-quantum future now.

## **Classical Computing Security Guide**

---

### **1. Core Principles**
- **Confidentiality**: Safeguard sensitive data through encryption, access controls, and monitoring.
- **Integrity**: Ensure data accuracy and protection against unauthorized modifications.
- **Availability**: Maintain system and data accessibility via redundancy, backups, and failover systems.

---

### **2. Network Security**
#### **Modern Approaches**
- **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)** and **Network Function Virtualization (NFV)**:
  - Enable centralized control, dynamic network segmentation, and automated threat response.

#### **Segmentation and Isolation**
- Use **micro-segmentation** with SDN to isolate workloads and enforce Zero Trust principles.
- Implement VLANs and firewalls to limit east-west traffic.

#### **Traffic Monitoring**
- Deploy **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**.
- Use **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)** to detect anomalies in traffic.  
  - *While DPI can be effective, its ability to inspect encrypted traffic is limited. Techniques like TLS inspection (with appropriate consent and controls) or analysis of encrypted metadata can provide additional insights.*

#### **Zero Trust Architecture**
- Enforce **least-privilege access** for all users, devices, and applications.
- Apply continuous authentication and behavior-based policies.

---

### **3. Endpoint Protection**

#### **IAM Best Practices**
- Implement **Single Sign-On (SSO)** with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
- Use context-aware access controls, considering device health, location, and user behavior.

#### **Password Management**
- Deploy enterprise password managers to enforce strong, unique passwords.
- Adopt passwordless authentication mechanisms like biometrics or hardware tokens.  
  - *While passwordless authentication is the future, organizations should implement robust password policies, including minimum length, complexity requirements, and regular password changes, until passwordless solutions are fully deployed.*

---

### **5. Data Protection**
#### **Encryption**
- Encrypt data at rest using AES-256 and in transit using TLS 1.3.
- Deploy robust **Key Management Systems (KMS)** to secure encryption keys.

#### **Data Backup**
- Use **cloud-based immutable backups** with automated replication and geographic redundancy.
- Regularly test data restoration processes to ensure recovery readiness.  
  - *Ensure the backup infrastructure itself is secured with strong access controls, encryption, and regular vulnerability management to prevent backups from being compromised.*

#### **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**
- Implement DLP solutions to monitor sensitive data transfers and prevent unauthorized sharing.

---

### **6. Secure Software Development**
#### **Application Security**
- Use **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)** to detect vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- Perform regular static and dynamic code analysis with SAST and DAST tools.

#### **DevSecOps Integration**

Summary of **Classical Computing Security** and **Quantum Security**, including an explanation of **Post-Quantum** and other key terms in layman’s terms:

---

### **Classical Computing Security**
**Classical computing security** focuses on protecting current, non-quantum IT systems from threats. It includes:
- **Core Principles**: Confidentiality (keep secrets safe), integrity (ensure data is accurate), and availability (keep systems up and running).
- **Network Security**: Using firewalls, segmenting networks, and monitoring traffic to stop attackers.
- **Endpoint Protection**: Protecting devices like computers and servers with antivirus, patching, and advanced detection tools.
- **Access Control**: Managing who gets access to what, with techniques like multi-factor authentication and strong password policies.
- **Data Protection**: Encrypting sensitive information and maintaining secure, tested backups.
- **Incident Response**: Having a plan to detect, respond to, and recover from cyberattacks.
- **Advanced Threat Mitigation**: Using tools like AI and threat intelligence to proactively stop sophisticated attacks.

---

### **Quantum Security**
**Quantum security** prepares for the impact of **quantum computers**, which will be able to break many existing cryptographic systems. Key aspects include:
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)**: Developing and adopting encryption methods that resist quantum attacks.
- **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**: Using the laws of quantum physics to create encryption keys that are secure against eavesdropping.

- **Quantum-Aware Systems**: Preparing IT systems for hybrid cryptography (mixing classical and post-quantum methods) as we transition to a quantum-safe future.

---

### **What is Post-Quantum?**
**Post-Quantum** refers to the technologies and strategies designed to remain secure even after quantum computers become powerful enough to break current encryption. It doesn’t mean "after quantum computers arrive"; it means being prepared **before** they do. Post-quantum cryptography aims to:
- Replace current encryption algorithms like RSA and ECC (used in nearly all digital communications).
- Use algorithms based on hard mathematical problems (e.g., lattice-based or hash-based cryptography) that even quantum computers can't easily solve.

---

### **Fancy Tech Jargon Explained**
- **Encryption**: Scrambling data so only authorized users can read it.
- **Key Management**: Safeguarding the "keys" that unlock encrypted data.
- **Zero Trust**: A "trust no one" security approach where every access request must be verified.
- **SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)**: Automating cybersecurity tasks to handle threats faster and with less human effort.
- **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)**: Tools that monitor and protect devices like laptops and servers.
- **XDR (Extended Detection and Response)**: A step up from EDR that integrates data from multiple layers (e.g., network, cloud).
- **TLS Inspection**: Checking encrypted traffic for malicious activity while keeping it secure.
- **Immutable Backups**: Backups that can’t be modified or deleted, even by ransomware.
- **Threat Hunting**: Proactively searching for cyber threats that haven’t been detected by automated tools.
- **QKD (Quantum Key Distribution)**: A secure way to exchange encryption keys using quantum particles.
- **Harvest Now, Decrypt Later**: A strategy where attackers collect encrypted data today to decrypt it once they have quantum computers.
